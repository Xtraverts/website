			“Xtraverts started late 1976 with singer Nigel Martin, guitarist Mark Reilly and drummer Tim Brick deciding to form some kind of band. This was inspired by Nigel jumping on stage and gatecrashing a gig by Deathwish in High Wycombe 4th Dec '76. 
		By mid '77 they were playing their first gigs in Wycombe with other local bands and had recruited Deathwish guitarist Kris Jozajtis on bass guitar. September that year they had a break supporting 999 and by 1978 were the biggest local band releasing their debut single 'Blank Generation/A 
		Lad Insane' early that year. 
		1979 saw the release of their second single 'Police State/Plastic People'. Both singles were aired by John Peel on his late night Radio 1 show more than a few times. 
		1981 saw them make an appearance on ITV’s ‘The Danny Baker Show’ with a feature and interview. 
		Third single ’Speed/1984’ was released in 1981. 
		After a couple more line up changes they had a large and loyal local following but for some reason didn't really take this to a national level. Constant line up changes could've had something to do with it as well as a departure by Martin to another musical project Zero Zero. 
		Rat Scabies (The Damned) made a surprise appearance as drummer for one of their gigs and guitarist Mark Reilly left and formed 80's pop band Matt Bianco. 
		Things cooled down for many years with sporadic incarnations of Xtraverts now and then. 
		Within the last two or three years there's been a more solid return from Martin and a strong new line up recording a new album ‘Xtraverts London’, playing regular gigs and selling new merchandise. 
		Xtraverts were at the beginning of Britain's 70's punk explosion and are here again 44 years later entertaining new and old fans.”
